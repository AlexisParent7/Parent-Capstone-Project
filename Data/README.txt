Created on 11/6/2024 for Biostats capstone data project by Alexis Parent. 

There are two csv files located within the data file. 

Fig_S9.csv: 
- This data file shows the site, how many years of rotation, the litter, POM, and MAOM. From this data file I will be using the rotation (# of years crop has been rotated) and both the POM and MAOM respectively. 

fig_S17.csv: 
- This data file shows crop sites, and different nutrient information that the sites have. However, from this csv file I will only be using data from columns SOC and comparing that relationship to total_N (total nitrogen in the soil). The other columns will not be utilized.
