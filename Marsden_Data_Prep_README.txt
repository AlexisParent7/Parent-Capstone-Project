Description: In the fall of 2021, 36 soil samples were collected in the Marsden agroecosystem diversification experiment at Marden Farm at Iowa State University, where measurements of soil carbon decomposition and nitrogen mineralization were measured. Although a plethora of tests were conducted, I am specifically looking at POM and MAOM over different year rotations. Over the 4 years, how the CO2 changed in the soil and if that had any correlation with the change (if any) in the POM or MAOM. 

Key: I did not edit any of the original data sets. 

Fig_S9: 
- Site: what site and what crop was planted at which site 
- Rotation: (2-4) what year rotation the crop was on during the experiment
- Litter: Accumulation of dead plant material 
- POM: Particulate organic matter measured. Which consists of plant and animal remnants at various different stages of decomposition. Known to cycle quickly. 
- MAOM:  Mineral associated organic matter which consists of bodies and byproducts of fungi and bacteria. Known to cycle more slowly than POM.

I will only be using two columns, which are SOC and total_N. 
- crop_sites: crop planted in year 2021 (The name for each plot is defined by concatenating the treatment name and the replicate number with an underscore.)
- SOC: Soil organic carbon content in kg C m-2. 
- total_N: total nitrogen in the soil in kg N m-2. 
- microbial_C_pool: microbial C pool 1_C mass, kg C m-2. 
- non_protected-C pool: 
- protected-C_pool
- soil_passive_C_pool: 
- root_C: Root carbon mass in kg C m-2. 
- root_N: Root nitrogen content in kg C m-2. 
- SOC_delta: delta 13 C values of soil organic carbon per ml. 
- microbial C pool 1_delta: delta 13 C values of microbial C pool1 (micro-K) per ml. 
- non_protected_C_pool_delta: delta 13 C values of microbial C pool2 (micro-r) per ml. 
- protected_C_pool_delta: delta 13 C values of protected C pool per ml. 
- soil_passive_C_pool_delta: delta 13 C values of soil passive C pool per ml.
